# Day 29: Introduction to JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. What is JDBC? (API to connect Java with DBs).
2. JDBC Architecture (Driver Manager, Driver, Connection).
3. Types of JDBC Drivers.
4. Establishing a connection with MySQL.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I stepped into the world of databases. JDBC acts as a bridge between my Java code and the database (like MySQL). I learned that I need a specific "Driver" (JAR file) for the database I am using. The `DriverManager` class helps in establishing the connection using a Connection URL, Username, and Password.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class Day29 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Database credentials
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb";
        String user = "root";
        String password = "password";

        try {
            // Establishing Connection
            Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
            System.out.println("Connection Established Successfully!");
            conn.close();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.out.println("Connection Failed: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
