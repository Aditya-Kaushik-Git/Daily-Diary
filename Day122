# Day 122: Deploying Apps on K8s

**Topics Covered:**
1. What is a **Pod**? (Smallest unit of K8s).
2. Pod vs Container (One Pod can have helper containers).
3. What is a **Deployment**? (Manages Pods and Replicas).
4. Writing `deployment.yaml`.

**Learning Summary:**
In Docker, we run "Containers". In K8s, we run "**Pods**". A Pod wraps the container.
However, we rarely create Pods directly. We create a **Deployment**. The Deployment manages the Pods (e.g., handles updates, rollbacks). Today I wrote a YAML file to deploy my Spring Boot Docker image into the cluster.

**Code Snippet (deployment.yaml):**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: springboot-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2 # Run 2 copies of the app
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: springboot-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: springboot-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: springboot-container
        image: my-docker-hub-id/springboot-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
