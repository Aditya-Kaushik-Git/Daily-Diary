# Day 7: Modular Programming with Methods

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. Defining Methods: Syntax and Structure.
2. Return Types (`void` vs `int`, `String`, etc.).
3. Method Parameters and Arguments.
4. Code Reusability and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

**Learning Summary:**
Methods help break down complex logic into smaller, manageable blocks. Today I learned the difference between `void` methods (which just do a task) and methods that return a value. I wrote a method to calculate the factorial of a number, which I can now reuse anywhere in my code.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
public class Day7 {
    // Method to calculate sum
    public static int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Method with no return type
    public static void greetUser(String name) {
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome back.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        greetUser("Developer");
        
        int result = addNumbers(10, 25);
        System.out.println("The sum is: " + result);
    }
}
