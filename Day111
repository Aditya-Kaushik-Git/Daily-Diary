# Day 111: Need for Speed

**Topics Covered:**
1. Why Database calls are expensive.
2. What is Caching? (Cache Hit vs Cache Miss).
3. Introduction to **Redis** (Remote Dictionary Server).
4. Setting up Redis using Docker.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I learned about performance optimization.
- **Problem:** Fetching a user profile takes 200ms from MySQL (Disk I/O).
- **Solution:** Store that profile in Redis (RAM). Fetching takes 5ms.
Redis is an in-memory key-value store. I added a Redis container to my `docker-compose.yml` to start using it.

**Docker Compose Snippet:**
```yaml
  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
