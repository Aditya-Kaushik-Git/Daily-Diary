# Day 126: Automating the Workflow

**Topics Covered:**
1. What is **CI** (Continuous Integration)? (Code -> Build -> Test).
2. What is **CD** (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)? (Test -> Release -> Deploy).
3. The "Integration Hell" problem.
4. Tools: Jenkins vs GitHub Actions vs GitLab CI.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I learned that "It works on my machine" is not enough. When working in a team, merging code often breaks things.
- **CI:** Whenever I push code, an automated server compiles it and runs tests. If tests fail, the merge is blocked.
- **CD:** If CI passes, the code is automatically packaged (Docker Image) and sent to the server.
I chose **GitHub Actions** because it is built right into my repository and is free for public projects.

**Key Concept:**
Automation reduces human error. I don't need to manually run `mvn test` anymore; the pipeline does it for me.
