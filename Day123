# Day 123: Exposing the Application

**Topics Covered:**
1. The problem: Pod IPs change dynamically.
2. What is a **Service**? (Stable IP/DNS).
3. Types: **ClusterIP** (Internal), **NodePort** (External dev), **LoadBalancer** (Prod).
4. Accessing the app from the browser.

**Learning Summary:**
Yesterday I deployed the app, but I couldn't access it because Pods are isolated inside the cluster. Today I learned about **Services**. A Service sits in front of the Pods and acts like a permanent address. Even if Pods die and new ones come up with new IPs, the Service IP stays the same.
I used **NodePort** to expose the app on a specific port of my laptop.

**Code Snippet (service.yaml):**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: springboot-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: springboot-app # Connects to the Deployment
  type: NodePort      # Expose to outside world
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80        # Service Port
      targetPort: 8080 # Container Port
      nodePort: 30007  # Access via localhost:30007
