# Day 129: Continuous Delivery (Pushing to Docker Hub)

**Topics Covered:**
1. GitHub Secrets (Storing Passwords securely).
2. Logging into Docker Hub via CLI.
3. Building the Docker Image in the pipeline.
4. Pushing the image to the Registry.

**Learning Summary:**
Now that my code is tested, I want to package it. Today I extended the pipeline to build a Docker Image and push it to Docker Hub automatically.
I learned about **GitHub Secrets**. I shouldn't put my Docker password in the YAML file. Instead, I added it in *Repo Settings > Secrets* and accessed it using `${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}`.

**Code Snippet:**
```yaml
  - name: Login to Docker Hub
    uses: docker/login-action@v2
    with:
      username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
      password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
      
  - name: Build and Push
    uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
    with:
      context: .
      push: true
      tags: my-docker-id/my-app:latest
