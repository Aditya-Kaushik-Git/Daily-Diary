# Day 77: What is JWT?

**Topics Covered:**
1. Session-based vs Token-based Authentication.
2. Structure of JWT (Header, Payload, Signature).
3. Why JWT is stateless.
4. When to use JWT.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I learned the theory behind JWT.
- **Session (Old way):** Server stores login info in memory (RAM). If server restarts, everyone is logged out.
- **JWT (New way):** Server generates a token and gives it to the client. The client saves it. For every request, the client shows this token. The server doesn't need to remember anything (Stateless).
A JWT looks like `aaaaa.bbbbb.ccccc` (Header.Body.Signature).

**Concept:**
The **Signature** part ensures that no one tampered with the token. If a hacker changes the payload (e.g., changes role from "USER" to "ADMIN"), the signature validation will fail.
