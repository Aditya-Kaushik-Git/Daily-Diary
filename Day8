# Day 8: Object-Oriented Programming - Classes & Objects

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. Concept of OOPs (Real-world modeling).
2. Creating a Class (The Blueprint).
3. Creating an Object (The Instance).
4. Accessing class attributes and methods via objects.

**Learning Summary:**
Today marks a major shift in my learning curve: OOPs. I learned that a Class is just a template (like a blueprint for a house), and an Object is the actual entity created from that template. I created a `Car` class with attributes like `color` and `model` and created multiple objects from it.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
class Car {
    String brand;
    int speed;

    void drive() {
        System.out.println(brand + " is driving at " + speed + " km/h.");
    }
}

public class Day8 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating Object 1
        Car myCar = new Car();
        myCar.brand = "Tesla";
        myCar.speed = 120;
        
        // Creating Object 2
        Car anotherCar = new Car();
        anotherCar.brand = "Toyota";
        anotherCar.speed = 80;

        myCar.drive();      // Tesla is driving...
        anotherCar.drive(); // Toyota is driving...
    }
}
