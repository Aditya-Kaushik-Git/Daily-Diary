# Day 60: Writing Custom Logic with @Query

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. `@Query` annotation.
2. JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language).
3. Native SQL Queries.
4. `@Modifying` and `@Transactional` for updates.

**Learning Summary:**
Sometimes derived methods aren't enough for complex logic. Today I learned JPQL. It looks like SQL, but instead of table names, we use **Class Names**. It is database independent. I also learned how to execute raw SQL (Native Query) if absolutely necessary.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {

    // 1. JPQL Query (Uses Class name 'Employee')
    @Query("SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.department = ?1")
    List<Employee> getEmployeesByDept(String dept);

    // 2. Native SQL Query (Uses Table name 'tbl_employees')
    @Query(value = "SELECT * FROM tbl_employees WHERE full_name LIKE %?1%", nativeQuery = true)
    List<Employee> searchByNameRaw(String keyword);
}
