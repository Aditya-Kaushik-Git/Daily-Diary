# Day 3: Arithmetic Operators and Scanner Class

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, %).
2. Relational Operators (==, !=, >, <).
3. Logical Operators (&&, ||, !).
4. Taking user input using the `Scanner` class.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I made my programs interactive. Instead of hardcoding values, I used the `java.util.Scanner` class to take input from the console. I also played around with the Modulus operator (`%`) which is very useful for finding even/odd numbers.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Day3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int num = sc.nextInt();
        
        // Using Modulus to check even/odd
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println(num + " is Even.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(num + " is Odd.");
        }
        sc.close();
    }
}
