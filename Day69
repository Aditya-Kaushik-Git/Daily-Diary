# Day 69: Complete CRUD from UI

**Topics Covered:**
1. Passing IDs to functions in JS.
2. Sending DELETE requests (`fetch(url, { method: 'DELETE' })`).
3. Sending PUT requests for updates.
4. UI feedback (removing element from DOM without reload).

**Learning Summary:**
I completed the CRUD cycle today. I added a "Delete" button next to each item. When clicked, it calls a JS function that takes the `id`, sends a DELETE request to Spring Boot (`/api/users/{id}`), and upon success, removes that HTML element from the screen. This makes the app feel fast and responsive.

**Code Snippet:**
```javascript
async function deleteUser(id) {
    if(!confirm("Are you sure?")) return;

    const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:8080/api/users/${id}`, {
        method: "DELETE"
    });

    if (response.ok) {
        // Remove from UI immediately
        document.getElementById(`user-row-${id}`).remove(); 
    } else {
        alert("Could not delete user.");
    }
}
