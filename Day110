# Day 110: Writing the Consumer Service

**Topics Covered:**
1. The `@KafkaListener` annotation.
2. Deserializing JSON back to Java Object.
3. Handling Consumer Groups.
4. Processing the event (Simulating email sending).

**Learning Summary:**
Today I made the `Notification-Service` listen to Kafka.
I used the `@KafkaListener` annotation on a method. Whenever a new message lands in `notificationTopic`, this method triggers automatically. It receives the `OrderEvent` object, and I wrote logic to "send an email" (print to console).

**Code Snippet:**
```java
@Service
public class NotificationConsumer {

    @KafkaListener(topics = "notificationTopic", groupId = "notificationId")
    public void handleNotification(OrderEvent event) {
        // Logic to send email
        System.out.println("Received Order Event for Order ID: " + event.getOrderId());
        System.out.println("Sending Email to: " + event.getEmail());
    }
}
