# Day 136: Moving to the Cloud

**Topics Covered:**
1. What is Cloud Computing? (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
2. Introduction to **AWS** (Amazon Web Services).
3. Core Services: **EC2** (Virtual Servers), **S3** (Storage), **RDS** (Database).
4. Why companies prefer Cloud over own Data Centers.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I learned where modern apps live. Instead of buying physical servers, we rent them.
- **EC2:** It's like a computer in the cloud. I can run my Docker container here.
- **S3:** It's like Google Drive for apps. I can store user profile photos here.
- **RDS:** It's a managed Database. AWS takes care of backups and patching.

**Key Concept:**
"Pay as you go". I only pay for the hours my server is running. This is perfect for startups and scaling applications.
