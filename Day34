# Day 34: Mastering Layouts with the Box Model

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. Concept of the Box Model.
2. Content, Padding, Border, Margin.
3. `box-sizing: border-box` (The lifesaver property).
4. Controlling element width and height.

**Learning Summary:**
This is arguably the most important concept in CSS. Every element on a webpage is a rectangular box. I learned the difference between **Padding** (space inside the box) and **Margin** (space outside the box). I also discovered `box-sizing: border-box`, which includes padding and border in the element's total width, preventing layout breakage.

**Code Snippet:**
```css
/* Resetting defaults */
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

.card {
    width: 300px;
    background-color: white;
    
    /* Space outside the card */
    margin: 20px auto; 
    
    /* Thickness of the box edge */
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    
    /* Space inside the card (between content and border) */
    padding: 15px;
}
