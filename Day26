# Day 26: Multitasking with Threads

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. Process vs. Thread (Lightweight processes).
2. Creating Threads: Extending `Thread` class.
3. Creating Threads: Implementing `Runnable` interface.
4. The `start()` vs `run()` method distinction.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I learned how to perform multiple tasks simultaneously in Java using Multithreading. This is crucial for performance. I learned two ways to create threads. Implementing `Runnable` is better because Java doesn't support multiple inheritance, so I can still extend another class if needed. I also learned that calling `run()` directly treats it like a normal method, whereas `start()` actually creates a new thread in memory.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
class MyTask implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Task Running: " + i);
            try { Thread.sleep(500); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        }
    }
}

public class Day26 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyTask task = new MyTask();
        Thread thread = new Thread(task);
        
        thread.start(); // Starts a new thread
        
        // Main thread continues simultaneously
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Main Thread: " + i);
        }
    }
}
