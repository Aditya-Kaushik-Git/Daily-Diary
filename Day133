# Day 133: Advanced Caching Patterns

**Topics Covered:**
1. Where to Cache? (Client, CDN, Server, Database).
2. **Cache-Aside Pattern:** App checks cache, if miss, loads from DB and updates cache.
3. **Write-Through:** Update Cache and DB simultaneously (Slow write, fast read).
4. **Write-Back:** Update Cache first, update DB later asynchronously (Fast write, risk of data loss).

**Learning Summary:**
I already used Redis, but today I learned *strategies* on how to use it effectively.
- **Cache-Aside** is the most common. It is resilient (if cache fails, app still works).
- **Write-Back** is great for write-heavy apps (like analytics), but if the cache crashes before saving to DB, data is lost.
I also learned about **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** which caches static files (images, CSS) closer to the user's location geographically.
