# Day 95: Creating a Microservice Client

**Topics Covered:**
1. Creating a `user-service`.
2. Adding `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client`.
3. The `@EnableDiscoveryClient` annotation.
4. Connecting to Eureka Server.

**Learning Summary:**
I created my first actual microservice: `user-service`. I wanted it to automatically tell the Eureka Server that it is alive.
1. Added the Eureka Client dependency.
2. In `application.yml`, I gave it a name (`spring.application.name=user-service`) and pointed it to the Eureka URL (`http://localhost:8761/eureka`).
3. Ran the application.

**Code Snippet:**
```yaml
spring:
  application:
    name: user-service # Important ID for discovery

eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
