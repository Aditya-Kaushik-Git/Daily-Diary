# Day 70: Mini-Project - Employee Management System

**Topics Covered:**
1. Project Planning (Database Schema, API Endpoints, UI Design).
2. Backend Implementation (Entity, Repo, Service, Controller).
3. Frontend Implementation (HTML, CSS, JS Fetch).
4. Testing the full flow.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I consolidated everything I learned in the last 70 days. I built a simple **Employee Management System**.
- **Backend:** Spring Boot + MySQL (storing Name, Email, Department).
- **Frontend:** A clean HTML page to View All Employees and Add New Employee.
- **Integration:** Used Fetch API and handled CORS.

**Project Logic Flow:**
1. User opens page -> JS fetches data -> Spring Boot queries DB -> Data displayed.
2. User adds employee -> JS sends JSON -> Spring Boot saves to DB -> Returns 201 Created.

**Reflection:**
I realized how powerful it feels to build the entire system from scratch. I am officially a Full Stack Developer (Beginner level)!
