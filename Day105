# Day 105: Debugging in Microservices

**Topics Covered:**
1. The problem with logs in Microservices.
2. Distributed Tracing concept (Trace ID vs Span ID).
3. Using **Micrometer Tracing** (formerly Sleuth) and **Zipkin**.
4. Visualizing the request flow.

**Learning Summary:**
Debugging a Monolith is easy (one log file). But in Microservices, one request hits Gateway -> Order -> User -> DB. If an error occurs, how do I find where? Today I learned about Distributed Tracing.
- **Trace ID:** A unique ID assigned to the entire request chain.
- **Span ID:** A unique ID for each individual service hop.
I setup **Zipkin** (a UI tool) to visualize how much time the request spent in each service.

**Code Snippet:**
