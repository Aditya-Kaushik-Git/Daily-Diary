# Day 9: Initializing Objects with Constructors

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. What is a Constructor? (Special method, same name as class).
2. Default Constructor vs Parameterized Constructor.
3. The `this` keyword to refer to the current object instance.
4. Constructor Overloading.

**Learning Summary:**
I learned that Constructors are used to initialize objects immediately upon creation. It removes the need to manually set values line-by-line like I did yesterday. The `this` keyword was a bit confusing initially, but I understood it helps distinguish between class attributes and method parameters when they have the same name.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
class Student {
    String name;
    int rollNo;

    // Parameterized Constructor
    Student(String name, int rollNo) {
        this.name = name;      // 'this.name' refers to the class variable
        this.rollNo = rollNo;
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Student: " + name + " | Roll No: " + rollNo);
    }
}

public class Day9 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student("Amit", 101);
        Student s2 = new Student("Rahul", 102);

        s1.display();
        s2.display();
    }
}
