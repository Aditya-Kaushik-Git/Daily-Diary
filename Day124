# Day 124: Managing Configuration

**Topics Covered:**
1. Externalizing Configs (12-Factor App principle).
2. **ConfigMap**: Storing plain text (URLs, Properties).
3. **Secret**: Storing sensitive data (Passwords, Keys) encoded in Base64.
4. Injecting them as Environment Variables.

**Learning Summary:**
Hardcoding database passwords in the Docker image is a security risk. Today I learned to use K8s **Secrets** and **ConfigMaps**.
- I stored the DB URL in a ConfigMap.
- I stored the DB Password in a Secret.
Then, I updated my `deployment.yaml` to read these values and inject them into the Spring Boot application as environment variables (`SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`).

**Code Snippet:**
```yaml
env:
  - name: DB_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: db-secret
        key: password
