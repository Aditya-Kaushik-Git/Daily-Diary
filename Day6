# Day 6: Handling Multiple Values with Arrays

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. Declaring and initializing Single Dimensional Arrays.
2. Accessing elements using Indexing (0-based).
3. Iterating through arrays using For Loop and Enhanced For-Loop (For-Each).
4. Basics of Multi-dimensional Arrays (2D Matrix).

**Learning Summary:**
Today I learned how to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable using Arrays. I realized that arrays have a fixed size once initialized. I also practiced the 'Enhanced For-Loop', which makes iterating through elements much cleaner and easier than the traditional loop.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
public class Day6 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declaration and Initialization
        int[] marks = {85, 90, 78, 88, 92};
        
        System.out.println("Using Enhanced For-Loop:");
        for (int score : marks) {
            System.out.print(score + " ");
        }
        
        System.out.println("\n\n2D Array Example:");
        int[][] matrix = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
        System.out.println("Element at (1,0): " + matrix[1][0]); // Output: 3
    }
}
