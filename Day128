# Day 128: Continuous Integration (CI) for Spring Boot

**Topics Covered:**
1. Setting up JDK in the runner.
2. Running Maven commands (`mvn clean verify`).
3. Caching dependencies (to speed up builds).
4. Failing the pipeline on Test Failure.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I made the pipeline useful. I configured it to set up Java 17 and run my JUnit tests automatically.
Now, if I make a mistake in my code and push it, the pipeline will fail (Red X), and I will get an email notification. This ensures that the `main` branch always contains working code.

**Code Snippet:**
```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  
  - name: Set up JDK 17
    uses: actions/setup-java@v3
    with:
      java-version: '17'
      distribution: 'temurin'
      
  - name: Build with Maven
    run: mvn clean package
