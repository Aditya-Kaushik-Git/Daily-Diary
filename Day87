# Day 87: Running Java Outside the IDE

**Topics Covered:**
1. Why we need a JAR (Java Archive) file.
2. The `mvn package` command.
3. Running the app using Terminal (`java -jar`).
4. Passing arguments via command line.

**Learning Summary:**
Servers don't have IntelliJ installed. To run my Spring Boot app on a server, I need to package it into a single executable file. Today I used the terminal to build my project.
1. Command: `mvn clean package`
2. Result: A `.jar` file was created inside the `target` folder.
3. Run: I ran it using `java -jar my-app.jar`.

**Terminal Commands:**
```bash
# 1. Build the project (skipping tests for speed if needed)
mvn clean package -DskipTests

# 2. Navigate to target folder
cd target

# 3. Run the application
java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
