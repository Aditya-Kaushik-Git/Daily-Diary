# Day 81: Why Write Tests?

**Topics Covered:**
1. What is Unit Testing? (Testing small isolated blocks).
2. The Testing Pyramid (Unit > Integration > E2E).
3. JUnit 5 Framework Introduction.
4. Setting up `pom.xml` dependencies (`spring-boot-starter-test`).

**Learning Summary:**
Today I started learning how to write automated tests. I learned that manually checking APIs with Postman every time I change code is slow and risky. **Unit Testing** allows me to test individual methods instantly. Spring Boot comes with `spring-boot-starter-test` which includes **JUnit 5** (Jupiter), the standard library for testing in Java.

**Code Snippet:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
