# Day 16: Handling Errors Gracefully

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. What is an Exception? (Checked vs Unchecked).
2. `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks.
3. Preventing program crashes.
4. Exception Hierarchy (`Throwable` class).

**Learning Summary:**
Today I learned how to handle runtime errors so my application doesn't crash unexpectedly. I explored the `try-catch` block: the risky code goes in `try`, and the handling logic goes in `catch`. I also learned about the `finally` block, which executes regardless of whether an exception occurs (useful for closing connections).

**Code Snippet:**
```java
public class Day16 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
            System.out.println(numbers[5]); // This throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Array index is out of bounds!");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Something went wrong.");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Execution finished. Cleanup done.");
        }
    }
}
