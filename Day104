# Day 104: Giving It Another Shot

**Topics Covered:**
1. The **Retry** Pattern (Network blips).
2. The **Time Limiter** Pattern (Timeout).
3. Configuring Retry attempts and backoff (wait time).
4. Combining Retry with Circuit Breaker.

**Learning Summary:**
Sometimes failure is temporary (like a 1-second network glitch). In such cases, opening the circuit immediately is aggressive. Today I implemented **Retry**. I told Spring: "If the request fails, wait 1 second and try again up to 3 times." I also added a **Time Limiter** to ensure no request takes longer than 2 seconds.

**Configuration:**
```yaml
resilience4j:
  retry:
    instances:
      userService:
        maxRetryAttempts: 3
        waitDuration: 2s
  timelimiter:
    instances:
      userService:
        timeoutDuration: 2s
