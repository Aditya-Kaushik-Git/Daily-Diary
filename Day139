# Day 139: Packaging the Journey

**Topics Covered:**
1. How to list these 140 days on a Resume.
2. The **STAR Method** for Interviews (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
3. Highlighting the "Full Stack Microservices Project".
4. Common Interview Questions (Java/Spring/System Design).

**Learning Summary:**
Today I focused on how to sell my skills. I shouldn't just say "I know Java".
**Resume Point Example:**
* "Designed and Deployed a Microservices-based E-commerce application using **Spring Boot** and **React**."
* "Implemented **Circuit Breaker Pattern** using Resilience4j to improve system uptime by 30%."
* "Automated deployment pipeline using **GitHub Actions** and **Docker**, reducing release time by 50%."

**Strategy:**
Projects speak louder than tutorials. I will showcase my GitHub repository as proof of work.
