# Day 131: Handling Growth

**Topics Covered:**
1. What happens when users increase from 100 to 1 Million?
2. **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up):** Adding more RAM/CPU to the existing server.
3. **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out):** Adding more servers (machines) to the pool.
4. Pros and Cons of each approach.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I learned the first rule of System Design.
- **Vertical Scaling:** Easy to manage, but expensive and has a hardware limit (you can't upgrade RAM infinitely). Also, it has a Single Point of Failure.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Cheaper (commodity hardware), infinite scaling potential, but requires complex management (Load Balancers, Distributed Databases).
Modern systems prefer Horizontal Scaling (Distributed Systems).

**Analogy:**
Vertical is like hiring a stronger horse. Horizontal is like hiring 10 normal horses to pull the cart together.
