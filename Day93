# Day 93: The Problem of Hardcoded URLs

**Topics Covered:**
1. Communication between Microservices.
2. Why we can't use `localhost:8081` in production.
3. What is Service Discovery? (The Phonebook of Microservices).
4. Client-Side vs Server-Side Discovery.

**Learning Summary:**
In a microservices world, services scale up and down (dynamic IP addresses). If Service A wants to call Service B, it cannot hardcode Service B's IP address because it might change. Today I learned about **Service Discovery**. It acts like a live directory where every service registers itself ("I am User-Service, available at IP 10.0.0.5").

**Concept:**
Instead of calling a specific IP, Service A asks the Discovery Server: "Give me the address of Service B", and then connects.
