# Day 116: Exposing Application Internals

**Topics Covered:**
1. What is Spring Boot Actuator?
2. Adding `spring-boot-starter-actuator`.
3. Critical Endpoints: `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/info`, `/actuator/metrics`.
4. Exposing endpoints safely.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I learned that a running application is like a black box. To see inside it (CPU usage, memory, database health), we need **Actuator**. It adds production-ready endpoints to our app.
- `/health`: Tells if the app is UP or DOWN.
- `/metrics`: Shows JVM memory, thread count, and HTTP request stats.

**Configuration:**
```yaml
# application.yml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health,info,metrics,prometheus # Expose these via HTTP
  endpoint:
    health:
      show-details: always # Show DB/Disk space details
