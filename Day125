# Day 125: The Power of K8s

**Topics Covered:**
1. Manual Scaling (`kubectl scale`).
2. Auto-Healing demonstration (Deleting a pod manually).
3. Rolling Updates (Updating app with zero downtime).
4. Rollback (Undoing a bad update).

**Learning Summary:**
Today I played with the real power of Kubernetes.
1. **Scaling:** I ran `kubectl scale deployment springboot-deployment --replicas=5`. Within seconds, 3 new pods started.
2. **Healing:** I manually deleted a pod. K8s noticed the count dropped to 4 (wanted 5), and immediately started a fresh replacement.
3. **Rolling Update:** I updated the image version. K8s updated pods one by one, ensuring the app never went down completely.

**Command:**
`kubectl rollout undo deployment springboot-deployment` (Reverts to previous version if the new code crashes).

**Milestone:**
I now understand how massive companies like Google/Netflix manage their servers!
