# Day 36: Making the Web Interactive

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. What is JavaScript? (Client-side scripting).
2. Linking JS to HTML (`<script>` tag).
3. Variables: `let`, `const`, and `var`.
4. Outputting data: `console.log()`, `alert()`.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I started JavaScript. Unlike HTML/CSS which are static, JS makes the page dynamic. I learned that `var` is old and has scope issues, so modern developers use `let` (for changeable values) and `const` (for constants). I also learned to check the browser console (F12) for debugging errors.

**Code Snippet:**
```javascript
// script.js

// Using const for fixed values
const appName = "My Daily Diary";

// Using let for values that change
let currentDay = 36;

console.log("Welcome to " + appName);
console.log("Current Progress: Day " + currentDay);

// Alert box in browser
// alert("JavaScript is linked successfully!");
