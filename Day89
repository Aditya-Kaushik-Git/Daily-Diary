# Day 89: Containerizing Spring Boot

**Topics Covered:**
1. What is a `Dockerfile`? (The blueprint).
2. Key Instructions: `FROM`, `COPY`, `ENTRYPOINT`.
3. Choosing a Base Image (OpenJDK).
4. Exposing Ports.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I wrote my first Dockerfile. It tells Docker how to build an image for my Spring Boot app.
1. **FROM:** Start with Java installed (OpenJDK).
2. **COPY:** Copy my generated JAR file into the container.
3. **ENTRYPOINT:** The command to run the app when container starts.

**Code Snippet:**
```dockerfile
# Use a lightweight Java runtime as a parent image
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine

# Set working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the JAR file from target folder to the container
COPY target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

# Expose port 8080
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
