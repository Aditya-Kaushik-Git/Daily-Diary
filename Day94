# Day 94: Creating a Discovery Server

**Topics Covered:**
1. Netflix Eureka (Spring Cloud Netflix).
2. Setting up a new Spring Boot Project.
3. Dependency: `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server`.
4. The `@EnableEurekaServer` annotation.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I started building my Microservices ecosystem. The first component is the **Eureka Server** (The Registry).
1. Created a new project `discovery-server`.
2. Added the Eureka Server dependency.
3. Annotated the main class with `@EnableEurekaServer`.
4. Configured it to not register itself (since it's the server, not a client).

**Configuration:**
```yaml
# application.yml
server:
  port: 8761

eureka:
  client:
    register-with-eureka: false
    fetch-registry: false
