# Day 115: Stateless Sessions with Redis

**Topics Covered:**
1. The problem with `HttpSession` in Microservices.
2. Sticky Sessions vs Distributed Sessions.
3. Adding `spring-session-data-redis`.
4. Sharing login state across multiple instances.

**Learning Summary:**
If I run 2 instances of `User-Service` behind a Load Balancer, a user might login on Instance A, but the next request goes to Instance B which doesn't know the user is logged in.
Today I solved this by storing the Session ID in **Redis** instead of the server's RAM. Now, both instances look at Redis to check if the user is logged in.

**Implementation:**
I just added the dependency `spring-session-data-redis` and configured:
```properties
spring.session.store-type=redis
