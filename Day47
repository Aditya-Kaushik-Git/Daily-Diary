# Day 47: The Spring IoC Container

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. What is Inversion of Control? (Don't call us, we'll call you).
2. The `ApplicationContext` (The Container).
3. What is a Spring Bean?
4. The shift from `new Class()` to Spring management.

**Learning Summary:**
In Core Java, if I needed an object, I used `new Car()`. In Spring, I learned that we shouldn't create objects manually. Instead, we give that responsibility to the **IoC Container**. The Container creates objects (called Beans), manages them, and destroys them when done. This makes the application loosely coupled and easier to test.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
// Traditional Approach (Tightly Coupled)
class Car {
    Engine engine = new Engine(); // Hardcoded dependency
}

// Spring Approach (IoC)
@Component
class Car {
    // The container will provide the Engine object
    // We don't say 'new Engine()' here.
    @Autowired
    Engine engine;
}
