# Day 2: Primitives and Non-Primitives in Java

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. Primitive Data Types: int, double, boolean, char, byte, long.
2. Non-Primitive Data Types: String, Arrays.
3. Variable naming conventions (camelCase).
4. Type Casting (Implicit vs Explicit).

**Learning Summary:**
I explored how Java stores data in memory. I learned that `int` is for whole numbers while `double` is for decimals. A key takeaway was "Type Casting" – converting a larger type (double) to a smaller type (int) requires explicit casting because data might be lost.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
public class Day2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 22;
        double salary = 45000.50;
        boolean isJavaFun = true;
        
        // Explicit Casting
        int roundedSalary = (int) salary; 
        
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
        System.out.println("Rounded Salary: " + roundedSalary);
        System.out.println("Is Java Fun? " + isJavaFun);
    }
}
