# Day 74: Storing Passwords Securely

**Topics Covered:**
1. Why storing plain text passwords is a crime.
2. Introduction to Hashing.
3. `PasswordEncoder` Interface.
4. Using `BCryptPasswordEncoder`.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I fixed the security flaw from yesterday. We should never store passwords as plain text ("1234"). Instead, we "Hash" them. I used **BCrypt**, which is a strong hashing algorithm. Even if a hacker gets the database, they won't know the real passwords because they are scrambled.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
@Bean
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
}

// Inside User Definition
UserDetails user = User.builder()
        .username("amit")
        .password(passwordEncoder().encode("1234")) // Hashes the password
        .roles("USER")
        .build();
