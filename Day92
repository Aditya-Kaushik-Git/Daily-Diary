# Day 92: Architecture Patterns

**Topics Covered:**
1. What is Monolithic Architecture? (Single JAR file).
2. What are Microservices? (Distributed systems).
3. Pros and Cons of each.
4. When to switch to Microservices.

**Learning Summary:**
Up until now, I built a **Monolith**—User logic, Product logic, and Order logic were all in one project. Today I learned about **Microservices**. In this architecture, we split the application into small, independent services (e.g., `user-service`, `order-service`) that talk to each other.
- **Monolith:** Easier to develop, harder to scale specific parts.
- **Microservices:** Harder to manage, but highly scalable and fault-tolerant.

**Analogy:**
Monolith is like a super-store where everything is under one roof. Microservices are like a shopping mall with separate specialized shops.
