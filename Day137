# Day 137: "Login with Google"

**Topics Covered:**
1. The problem with handling passwords manually.
2. What is **OAuth2**? (Authorization Framework).
3. What is **OpenID Connect**? (Authentication Layer).
4. Flow: Authorization Code Grant.

**Learning Summary:**
We implemented JWT earlier, but handling user passwords is risky. Today I learned about **OAuth2**. It allows users to log in using their existing accounts (Google/GitHub/Facebook).
- **Resource Owner:** The User.
- **Client:** My Application.
- **Authorization Server:** Google/Facebook.
My app gets an "Access Token" from Google to read the user's email, without ever seeing their password.

**Analogy:**
It's like giving a Valet Key to a parking attendant. The key opens the car door and starts the engine, but doesn't open the glove box or trunk.
