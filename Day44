# Day 44: Writing Clean Async Code

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. The `async` keyword (Functions return a Promise).
2. The `await` keyword (Pauses execution until Promise resolves).
3. Error Handling with `try...catch` blocks.
4. Why Async/Await is better than `.then()`.

**Learning Summary:**
While `.then()` works, chaining multiple requests looks messy. Today I learned `async/await`, introduced in ES8. It makes asynchronous code look like normal synchronous code. I used `try-catch` to handle errors, which felt very similar to Java's exception handling.

**Code Snippet:**
```javascript
// Function simulating data fetch
function fetchUser() {
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve("Amit"), 1000));
}

// Modern Async Function
async function displayUser() {
    console.log("Fetching user...");
    
    try {
        // Javascript waits here until promise resolves
        const user = await fetchUser(); 
        console.log("User found: " + user);
    } catch (error) {
        console.log("Something went wrong");
    }
}

displayUser();
