# Day 4: Making Decisions with If-Else and Switch

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. `if`, `else if`, and `else` blocks.
2. Nested if statements.
3. `switch` case statements (Traditional vs Enhanced Switch).
4. Ternary Operator (`? :`).

**Learning Summary:**
Control flow is the brain of the program. I practiced writing logic to grade students based on marks using `if-else`. I also learned the Ternary operator, which is a great shorthand for simple if-else conditions.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
public class Day4 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int day = 3;
        
        // Switch Case example
        switch (day) {
            case 1 -> System.out.println("Monday: Start Work");
            case 2 -> System.out.println("Tuesday: Keep Going");
            case 3 -> System.out.println("Wednesday: Mid-Week");
            default -> System.out.println("Weekend is near!");
        }
        
        // Ternary Operator
        String status = (day > 5) ? "Weekend" : "Weekday";
        System.out.println("Today is a " + status);
    }
}
