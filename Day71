# Day 71: Securing the Application

**Topics Covered:**
1. Why Security is crucial? (Authentication vs Authorization).
2. Adding `spring-boot-starter-security`.
3. Default Login behavior.
4. The generated password in Console.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I added the Spring Security dependency to my project. As soon as I restarted the server, everything got locked! I couldn't access my APIs anymore. I learned that Spring Security is "Secure by Default". It provides a default login page and generates a random password in the console logs. The default username is `user`.

**Code Snippet:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
