# Day 121: Introduction to Container Orchestration

**Topics Covered:**
1. Limits of Docker & Docker Compose (Manual management).
2. What is Kubernetes? (The Pilot of containers).
3. Architecture: Master Node (Control Plane) vs Worker Nodes.
4. Installing Minikube (Local K8s Cluster).

**Learning Summary:**
Today I started the most in-demand skill in DevOps: **Kubernetes**.
I learned that while Docker creates the container, managing 100 containers manually is impossible. If a container crashes, I have to restart it. Kubernetes does this automatically. It is a "Container Orchestrator".
- **Master Node:** The brain (Make decisions).
- **Worker Node:** The body (Does the work/runs apps).
I installed **Minikube** to practice K8s on my laptop.

**Key Concept:**
Kubernetes is self-healing. If I tell it "Keep 3 instances running", and one crashes, it instantly starts a new one to maintain the count.
