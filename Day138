# Day 138: Writing Clean Code

**Topics Covered:**
1. Why Design Patterns matter? (Standard solutions to common problems).
2. **Singleton Pattern:** Only one instance (e.g., Spring Beans).
3. **Factory Pattern:** Creating objects without specifying exact class.
4. **Observer Pattern:** Event Handling (like Kafka consumers).

**Learning Summary:**
Now that I know how to build systems, I need to write code that is maintainable.
- **Singleton:** Ensuring a class has only one instance (used in Database Connections).
- **Builder:** Used mainly in Lombok (`User.builder().name("Amit").build()`) to create complex objects clearly.
- **Strategy:** Swapping algorithms at runtime (e.g., Switching between PayPal and Stripe payment methods).

**Key Takeaway:**
Patterns are not code; they are blueprints for solving recurring architectural problems.
