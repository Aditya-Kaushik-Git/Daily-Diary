# Day 132: Distributing the Traffic

**Topics Covered:**
1. What is a Load Balancer (LB)?
2. Algorithms: Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hash.
3. Layer 4 (Transport) vs Layer 7 (Application) LB.
4. Health Checks.

**Learning Summary:**
If I have 5 servers, how does the user know which one to connect to? The **Load Balancer** sits at the entrance. It receives the request and forwards it to one of the backend servers.
I learned about different algorithms:
- **Round Robin:** Send to Server A, then B, then C, repeat.
- **Least Connections:** Send to the server handling the fewest active requests.
If a server crashes, the LB detects it (Health Check fails) and stops sending traffic there.

**Tools:**
Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ELB.
