# Day 5: Iterations and Loops

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. The `for` loop for fixed iterations.
2. The `while` loop for unknown iterations.
3. The `do-while` loop (executes at least once).
4. Break and Continue statements.

**Learning Summary:**
Loops allow us to repeat tasks without rewriting code. I created a program to print the multiplication table of a number. I also learned about infinite loops and how to avoid them using proper increment/decrement conditions.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
public class Day5 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Printing Table of 5 using For Loop
        System.out.println("Table of 5:");
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println("5 x " + i + " = " + (5 * i));
        }
        
        // While loop example
        int count = 5;
        while(count > 0) {
            System.out.print(count + " ");
            count--;
        }
        System.out.println("\nCountdown finished!");
    }
}
