# Day 107: Kafka Architecture Basics

**Topics Covered:**
1. What is Kafka? (Distributed Streaming Platform).
2. Core Concepts: **Topic**, **Producer**, **Consumer**, **Broker**.
3. Partitions and Offsets.
4. Consumer Groups.

**Learning Summary:**
Kafka is not just a queue; it's a log of events.
- **Topic:** A category/folder name (e.g., `notification-topic`).
- **Producer:** The service that sends data (Order Service).
- **Consumer:** The service that reads data (Email Service).
- **Broker:** The Kafka server that stores the data.
I learned that messages in Kafka are stored permanently (for a set time), allowing consumers to read past messages too, unlike standard queues that delete messages once read.
