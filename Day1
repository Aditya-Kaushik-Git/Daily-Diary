# Day 1: Java Environment Setup and First Program

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. Understanding how Java works (JDK, JRE, JVM).
2. Installing Java Development Kit (JDK 21) and IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Writing the first "Hello World" program.
4. Understanding the `public static void main(String[] args)` method.

**Learning Summary:**
Today marked the beginning of my 150-day coding challenge. I learned that Java is platform-independent because of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). The source code (.java) is compiled into bytecode (.class), which runs on any machine.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
public class Day1 {
    // This is the main entry point of the program
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        System.out.println("Starting my 150 Days of Code Challenge.");
    }
}
