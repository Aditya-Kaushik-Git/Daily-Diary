# Day 15: Memory Management and Constants

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. `static` variable and methods (Class level vs Object level).
2. Static Block.
3. `final` variable (Constant).
4. `final` method (prevent overriding) and `final` class (prevent inheritance).

**Learning Summary:**
Today I deep-dived into memory management keywords.
- **Static:** Belongs to the class, not the object. Shared among all instances. Good for counters or utility methods.
- **Final:** Used to create constants. A final variable's value cannot be changed once assigned.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
class Counter {
    static int count = 0; // Shared across all objects
    final double PI = 3.14159; // Constant
    
    Counter() {
        count++; // Increments the static variable
    }
}

public class Day15 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Counter();
        new Counter();
        new Counter();
        
        // Accessed using Class Name, not object
        System.out.println("Total Objects Created: " + Counter.count);
    }
}
