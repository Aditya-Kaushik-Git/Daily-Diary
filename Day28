# Day 28: Reading and Writing Files

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. Byte Streams (`FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`).
2. Character Streams (`FileReader`, `FileWriter`).
3. `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` for efficiency.
4. Try-with-Resources (Auto-closing streams).

**Learning Summary:**
Before moving to databases, it's important to know how to store data in files. I learned that Byte Streams are for images/videos, while Character Streams are for text. I used `BufferedWriter` because writing data directly to disk character-by-character is slow; buffering improves performance significantly.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
import java.io.*;

public class Day28 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Writing to a file
        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt"))) {
            writer.write("Hello, GitHub!");
            writer.newLine();
            writer.write("This is Day 28 of my challenge.");
            System.out.println("File written successfully.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Reading from a file
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("output.txt"))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println("Read: " + line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
