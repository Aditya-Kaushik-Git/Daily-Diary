# Day 91: Running App and Database Together

**Topics Covered:**
1. The problem with running containers manually.
2. What is `docker-compose`?
3. Writing a `docker-compose.yml` file.
4. Services, Networks, and Volumes in Compose.

**Learning Summary:**
Yesterday, I ran my App in a container, but it failed because it couldn't find the Database. Running a MySQL container separately and linking them manually via command line is painful. Today I learned about **Docker Compose**. It is a tool to define and run multi-container applications using a single YAML file.

**Code Snippet:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  mysqldb:
    image: mysql:8.0
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
    ports:
      - "3307:3306"

  springboot-app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - mysqldb # Ensures DB starts before App
    environment:
      # Using service name 'mysqldb' instead of localhost
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: jdbc:mysql://mysqldb:3306/mydb
