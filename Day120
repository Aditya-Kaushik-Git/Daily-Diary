# Day 120: Running the Monitoring Stack

**Topics Covered:**
1. Writing `docker-compose` for Prometheus + Grafana.
2. Configuring `prometheus.yml`.
3. Linking Spring Boot to the Monitoring Network.
4. Viewing the health of the entire system.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I set up the complete monitoring infrastructure using Docker. I didn't install Prometheus or Grafana on my laptop; I just ran them as containers.

**Docker Compose Snippet:**
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    ports: ["9090:9090"]
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana
    ports: ["3000:3000"]
    depends_on:
      - prometheus
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'spring_micrometer'
    metrics_path: '/actuator/prometheus'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['host.docker.internal:8080'] # Point to my Spring App
