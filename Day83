# Day 83: Faking Dependencies with Mockito

**Topics Covered:**
1. The problem with dependencies (Service needs Repository).
2. What is Mocking? (Creating dummy objects).
3. `@Mock` vs `@InjectMocks`.
4. The `Mockito` framework.

**Learning Summary:**
I faced a problem: How do I test my `UserService` without connecting to the real Database? If the DB is down, my test shouldn't fail. The solution is **Mockito**. It creates "fake" objects that simulate the behavior of real objects.
- `@Mock`: Creates a fake object (e.g., Fake Repository).
- `@InjectMocks`: Creates the real object (Service) and injects the mocks into it.

**Concept:**
We are testing the *logic* inside the Service, not the Database connection. So, we fake the DB interaction.
