# Day 118: Building Dashboards

**Topics Covered:**
1. What is Grafana? (Visualization Tool).
2. Connecting Grafana to Prometheus.
3. Importing pre-built Dashboards (ID: 4701 is popular for Spring Boot).
4. Visualizing RPS (Requests Per Second) and Errors.

**Learning Summary:**
Raw data in Prometheus is hard to read. Today I used **Grafana**, which is a UI tool.
1. I added Prometheus as a "Data Source" in Grafana.
2. I created graphs to show "CPU Usage" and "API Response Time".
3. I imported a community dashboard which instantly gave me professional charts for my Spring Boot app.

**Concept:**
**Spring Boot** (Generates Data) -> **Actuator** (Exposes Data) -> **Prometheus** (Collects Data) -> **Grafana** (Shows Data).
