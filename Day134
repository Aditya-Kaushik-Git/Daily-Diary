# Day 134: Scaling the Storage Layer

**Topics Covered:**
1. **Master-Slave Replication:** One Master (Writes), Multiple Slaves (Reads).
2. **Sharding (Partitioning):** Splitting data across multiple databases (e.g., User A-M in DB1, N-Z in DB2).
3. Consistent Hashing.
4. Problems with Sharding (Complex joins).

**Learning Summary:**
Databases are the hardest bottleneck to scale.
- **Replication:** Helps when we have too many *Reads*. All writes go to Master, data is copied to Slaves. Slaves handle read traffic.
- **Sharding:** Helps when we have too much *Data* (Terabytes). We split the tables. For example, users from India go to Shard 1, users from USA go to Shard 2.
Sharding makes "Join" queries very difficult because data is on different machines.
