# Day 13: Abstraction using Abstract Classes

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Topics Covered:**
1. What is Abstraction? (Hiding implementation details).
2. The `abstract` keyword.
3. Abstract Methods (method with no body).
4. Concrete Methods inside Abstract Classes.

**Learning Summary:**
Abstraction focuses on *what* an object does instead of *how* it does it. I learned that an `abstract` class cannot be instantiated (we can't make an object of it). It is meant to be a base for subclasses. If a class has an abstract method, the class itself must be abstract.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw(); // Abstract method (no body)
    
    void info() {
        System.out.println("This is a shape.");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}

public class Day13 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Shape s = new Shape(); // ERROR: Cannot instantiate abstract class
        Shape s = new Circle();
        s.draw();
        s.info();
    }
}
