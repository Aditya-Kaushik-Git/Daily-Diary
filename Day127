# Day 127: My First Workflow

**Topics Covered:**
1. The `.github/workflows` directory.
2. Structure of a YAML workflow file.
3. Concepts: **Events** (Push/Pull Request), **Jobs**, **Steps**, **Runners**.
4. Writing a simple "Hello World" pipeline.

**Learning Summary:**
Today I created my first automation script. I made a folder `.github/workflows` and added a file `maven.yml`.
- **Event:** I told it to run on `push` to the `main` branch.
- **Runner:** I specified `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` (GitHub provides a fresh Ubuntu VM for every run).
- **Steps:** I added simple commands to check out the code and print a message.

**Code Snippet (`ci.yml`):**
```yaml
name: Java CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Clones my repo
    - name: Run a one-line script
      run: echo Hello, GitHub Actions!
