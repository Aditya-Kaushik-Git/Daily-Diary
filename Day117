# Day 117: Collecting Metrics

**Topics Covered:**
1. What is Prometheus? (Time-series database).
2. Pull-based Architecture (Prometheus scrapes data).
3. Adding `micrometer-registry-prometheus`.
4. Verifying the `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint.

**Learning Summary:**
Actuator shows current data, but it doesn't store history. If the CPU spiked 5 hours ago, Actuator won't tell me. That's why I need **Prometheus**. It connects to my app every few seconds, reads the metrics, and stores them in its database with a timestamp.
I added Micrometer dependency which formats Actuator data into a format Prometheus understands.

**Code Snippet:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
